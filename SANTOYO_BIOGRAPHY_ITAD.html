	<div align="justify"><p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kentt Itchiro Santoyo boorn on August 4, 2001 in Iloilo city. He grew up in a town in iloilo city. <sup>1</sup> His parents told him he was very naughty when he was little, when he was only four years old, he had an accident in their area he was hit by a motorcycle then he was <sup>2</sup> taken to a very good hospital there he was treated. When he was only five years old he was mostly at home and protected by his parents. And when he was five<sup>3</sup> years old his parents suddenly separated after that he grew up at his mother's side.after that he worked as a teacher for two years. while he is not at his <sup>4</sup> father's side, he is still supporting him because he is the only child. When he was seven years old, his mother went to Manila to look for another job to <sup>5</sup> support his studies. 7 After that his mother met his step father who is very kind and hard working and also gives him everything he wants. He continued his studies <sup>6</sup> well, and when he was in grade four, his mother took him from the province to move to Manila. He was happy when his mother took him, but he was also sad because<sup>7</sup> he left his grandfather and grandmother in the province because he grew up with them. When he moved to school, he loved it even more because at a young age he <sup>8</sup> immediately thought about his future that he needed to study well so that he could have a good future and not be poor and not relying on his parents but his <sup>9</sup> ordeal in life as an elementary school student does not end here because it changes places and policies in schools in Manila because it is very far from the school he<sup>10</sup> grew up in in the province because at that time the schools in the province were very isolated to the students and the teachers do not hurt or beat them there, unlike here in Manila who pinch and beat them in the hand by rubber ruler. <sup>11</sup> when I was in grade five, I went home to iloilo city alone because my great-grandmother died and all our <sup>12</sup>relatives went home and it was like a family reunion because even though our family was in another country, they went home to iloilo<sup>13</sup> and after my great-grandmother was buried, we planned a family outing to somehow ease the pain in our hearts. and the elders then planned for us to go to the sea and cool off and to forget<sup>14</sup> our problems in life. And before the old family went home to their places of residence in different countries, they also planned to go to our mountains and<sup>15</sup>  observe and the rest of the family slept there for three days. <sup>15</sup> and after all our family members have gone home to another country to continue their <sup>16</sup> lives. and I left for another two weeks to make the most of my return home and to make new memories with my friends because I will be going back to Manila and travel <sup>17</sup> by myself on the bus and board the ship and after that  I will alone in one day to Manila very tired but with good memories. <sup>18</sup> And when I was in grade six, I was bullied in my school because there were many bullies and I was one of the bullies there because I wasn't that kind of kid who used to fight with them. <sup>19</sup> And that is the somw stories of my chilhood memories taht I can't forget it. <sup>20</sup>

	<div align="justify"><p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a teenager. when I was thirteen years old I returned to Iloilo City to continue my studies and<sup>1</sup> after that I enrolled in San Juan Academy and that's where I started my teenage life. And when I was thirteen, I lived with my father so that I could try or <sup>2</sup> experience growing up by his side. and when I was fourteen years old, I was spoiled brat by my father because he bought me a big bike motorcycle and that's when I fell <sup>3</sup> in love with motorcycling and after that I participated in various motor racing, and because of that my mother found out that that's how it's done He called me on <sup>4</sup> the phone, why am I doing that, it seems like he is neglecting my studies. and my mom also found out that I was having a motorcycle accident because I was playing <sup>5</sup> racing motorcycles. and because of that my mother called me and told me not to do that but I was happy. and because of that my mother decided that next year she <sup>6</sup> will bring me back to Manila and I will study there again. and the day of the vacation came and my mother called me saying that I should go on vacation in Manila  <sup>7</sup> and the province did not send me back. my mother called my grandmother to organize my school papers and send them here in manila. When I was fifteen years old, I <sup>8</sup> transferred to Quezon City Academy. at first I was sad but later I was happy because my other classmates from elementary school were there. and after that I spent some time in that school, my studies were good again and that section won various competitions.  <sup>9</sup>when I was sixteen years old my step father  taught me about the gym  and I was  addicted to it and lifting iron became my hobby. the last year in high school was very fitting and very sad, because my classmates and I were going to be <sup>10</sup> separated as if he had become his brother too. It's funny to think that we've graduated from high school but we won't see the others because they're going to another country. those memories are still imprinted it in my mind. <sup>11</sup> and during my senior high school year, it was very fun because it was a new environment.  <sup>12</sup> When I was in grade eleven, I enrolled in the University of the East Manila. <sup>13</sup> and there I took a strand is sports track because when I tried out for the weightlifting team of the University of the East I was taken as its athlete. <sup>14</sup> and I am very happy because of that. I see new faces and new teachers.and new classmates and new friends were added to my life. <sup>15</sup> and a year later it became grade twelve and this is my last year as a teenager and this is also the last year <sup>16</sup> I will be with my classmates in grade eleven. it's fun because we are graduates again. <sup>17</sup> it's just sad because they will leave the school again and we won't see each other again and this is my last time being an athlete at the University of the East <sup>18</sup> because there was a pandemic and our school team was canceled. <sup>19</sup> And this is the story of my teenage life <sup>20</sup>

	<div align="justify">
	
	<p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in my College Years, It still sucked that we have to do online classes to start out because of the pandemic. 1 Because of that, we have the lack of motivation to do school work because it was not face-to-face. 2 My daily routine would always be doing school work, playing video games with my friends, and going to sleep. 3 And that routine went on until the next year of college which was still online classes in the first semester. 4 Almost all of the time I was home and sitting in front of the computer, doing activities, answering quizzes, and so on. 5 My first year of college is very bland and it is the same day after day. 6 Before the second year, I moved to another house with my mother and sibling and the three of us are now living together. 7 When we moved the classes are still online until the start of the second semester of the second year of college. 8 After that, the classes were now face-to-face. 9 I met a lot of familiar faces that I only saw in online classes. 10

         I am still trying to adjust to the new class schedule and I am trying to adjust my sleeping schedule too. 11 My schedule makes me go home very late and I get home always at 9:00 pm. 12 There is still a lot that I am trying to adjust to in the new face-to-face method of classes. 13 I have to wake up early again after three years of the pandemic. 14 Because in online classes I could just wake up and turn on my computer to join my classes. 15 And this is the first time I actually got into UE so I am still kind of lost whenever I go there for my classes. 16 I sometimes get inside the wrong rooms for my classes so I still have to memorize everything. 17 Overall it is good to be back to this kind of method of classes. 18 I don't really like the online classes but yet again it has helped us a lot to learn even during the pandemic. 19 I am looking forward to the rest of my college days and I would like to learn more about my course and the people at UE. 20</dd></p>
