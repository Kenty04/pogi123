	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My skills are many, one of my skills is making or baking cakes because of my skills I earn money because <sup>1</sup> most of my friends order me a cake and I deliver it to them. and also because of my cake baking skills, my family and I sometimes have family bonding because we<sup>2</sup>  sometimes cook together. And second to my skills is my teaching of the right way to do it in the gym. because it is also one of my sources of income because I<sup>3</sup>  also teach people at the gym. and they also pay me here and because of my skills I meet a lot of people and they become my friends, and also because of my skills<sup>4</sup>  I can go anywhere and have a name among others' another place.And third of my skills is that I am a sporty person because of this skill I also earn money because<sup>5</sup>  I became a coach of leagues at a young age. I have many teams that have been touched and I have a team that has won the championship game. and because of these<sup>6</sup>  skills I have been able to go to different places in the Philippines and also because of these skills I have met many people and the people I have met become my<sup>7</sup>  friends. And my fourth skill is driving a motorcycle because of this skill I also earn money here because when I was still in the province I played motocross <sup>8</sup> there and also because of this skill I have been able to go to different places in the philippines and also because of this skill I also met a lot of people and<sup>9</sup>  they all became my friends. and another also because of these skills when I was still in the province when I didn't have time to go to school to study I used to<sup>10</sup>  work for extra income because I wanted to make money. And the fifth of my skills is being strategic in life, because my step-father himself taught me that no<sup>11</sup>  matter what happens in life you have to be strategic, be strategic to earn money every day and also strategize how to buy daily life needs in orderly and clean<sup>12</sup>  work. and because of these skills that were taught to me, I now live alone in the house I live in and I pay my expenses every day. and I am very thankful that<sup>13</sup>  he taught me while I was still young because he can use it in my life now. And the sixth of my skills is being able to do housework such as laundry, cooking, <sup>14</sup>  cleaning and many others, because in my generation especially when men are not good at housework because it is already in their minds that as a man you <sup>15</sup> shouldn't do that because doing things like that is only for women. and when you know these things what they tell you, but I prefer to know these things because when<sup>16</sup> the day comes when I have my own family I know that I know these things, and the These skills are easy to learn if you just want to learn. <sup>17</sup>
	and these are the only skills that I can share or say because my thoughts are just dogs, because I know that I have many more skills that I can do but I can't list them all <sup>18</sup> because there are so many of them. and I still wish that the skills that I will learn in my life will expand even more so that it will also help me in the right<sup>19</sup> times and I can also use it correctly. <sup>20</sup>.
